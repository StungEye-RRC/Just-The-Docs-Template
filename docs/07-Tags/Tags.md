# Introducing Tags

**Tags in Git are like bookmarks for important events or milestones in your project** 

They're often used to mark release points (v1.0.0, v1.1.0, etc.). 

## Creating Tags

**Creating a new lightweight tag:**

`git tag <tag-name>
git tag <tag-name> <commit hash>`

This will tag the current or specified commit with the provided name.

Tag names should not include spaces. They should only include characters [a-z], [A-Z],
numbers [0-9] and the dash/hyphen [-].


## Annotated Tags

Annotated tags store additional metadata such as the tagger's name, email, date, and
an optional message.

`git tag -a <tag-name> -m "your message here"`


## Once You've Created a Tag

**Checkout to the tag:** You can treat the tag like a branch/commit, and checkout to the
tag's point in history. For instance, `git checkout <tag-name>` .

**List Tags:** You can list all the tags in the repository using `git tag` or `git tag -l` . To
narrow the list based on a search pattern, you can use `git tag -l "<search-
pattern>"` .

**Show tag information:** If you have annotated tags, you can view the associated
information with `git show <tag-name>` .

**Compare differences:** You can compare the differences between the tagged state of
the code and the current HEAD using `git diff <tag-name>` .
