# When to Undo with Checkout?

The simplest private undo. **Discard uncommitted local changes.**

`git checkout <path-or-filename>`

Works if:
- The changes you wish to undo haven't yet been committed. (Dirty files.)
- You wish to revert to the most recently committed version of a file or files.

## Undoing with Checkout

Let's say you made a bunch of changes to your `readme.md` that you now regret.

If you haven't committed these changes, you can undo them like this:

`git checkout readme.md`

If you want to revert all folders and files to the most recent commit:

`git checkout .`

***WARNING:*** *Slightly dangerous. The discarded changes cannot be recovered!*
